				<p>It can be hard when your entire life has been a comparison to your sibling. What’s even worse is when the one comparing the two of you is none other but your dad.</p>
				<p>Emily, 21, spent her entire childhood and teenage years in the shadow of big sister, Linda. She didn’t have much of a choice to be fair. Linda, was a beautiful 24-year-old who was trying to make it as an actor/model.</p>
				<p>Emily, on the other hand, was just an everyday woman trying to make it as a writer. </p>
				<p>“I remember playing with my sister all the time when we were kids. She was a few years older, so I always looked up to her. I remember the day I realized that my dad didn’t appreciate me as much… ”</p>
				<p>We were playing in the backyard when my dad said “Hey princess, come sit here with me!”. So I ran to him but he immediately said “Not you! I meant your sister!”. To which I replied “You have to think of a nickname for me too dad”. ‘I don’t have time for this Emily!’, he said. That was when I knew!”, Emily explains.</p>
				<p>I spent most of my teenage years in my room. I was always good at school, but of course, I wasn’t my sister! She was always the popular one, and for my dad that was more important. This made me resort to food even more than before. </p>
				<p>Emily moved out of her parents’ house as soon as she graduated from college.</p>
				<p><img class="featured-image img-fluid" src="assets/img/2.jpg" alt=""></p>
				<p><strong>On Emily’s 21st birthday party</strong>></p>
				<p>I decided to celebrate my 21st birthday with my family. My sister was in town too, because her casting agency dropped her, so I thought we could all get together. </p>
				<p>When I got there, my mom asked about my new job but before I even got a word out my dad said “No! Let’s hear about Linda’s stories first!”.</p>
				<p>My sister of course started rumbling about her amazing life, so I just pretended I didn’t mind.</p>
				<p>When my mom brought the cake, I blew out the candles and got a piece for me when my dad said “Sure you wanna do that? You’re not gonna look any better with that!”.</p>
				<p>That was more than I could take! I started crying and then stormed out.</p>
				<p>I decided it was time for me to make some changes. I’d had enough of my dad’s attitude towards me. I started writing down everything that I went through during my childhood, and even now, and before I knew it, I had written a couple of pages. </p>
				<p>The next morning I took a look at what I’d written and thought  that I could write a book about it!. And then it just hit me! I should write a book about this!. It took me about 3 months, but I even found a publisher that was willing to give it a go! </p>
				<p>I never thought that it would become a best-seller! </p>
				<p><img class="featured-image img-fluid" src="assets/img/3.jpg" alt=""></p>
				<p>I hadn’t seen my parents since my birthday, so I figured this would be a good time to do so. I went in and told them about the book I had written, without mentioning the plot. Then I went over to my dad and handed him a copy all wrapped up!</p>
				<p>“Here dad! This is for you, I hope this time you’ll like what I did!”</p>
				<p>My dad unwrapped it and read the title “Hi! My name is Daughter Number Two!”. I turned around and left with a smile on my face… that was the last time I saw him and, honestly, I’m happier without him!</p>
